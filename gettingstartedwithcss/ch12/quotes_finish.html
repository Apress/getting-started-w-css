  <p>Some people are forever putting their foot in it, just like Alice did after the Caucus-race during her adventures in Wonderland:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: <q>Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for catching mice you can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!</q></p>
    <p class="last">This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, <q>I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!</q> and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, <q>Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!</q> On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When people start making excuses, and shuffling off, it's often a sign you have said something you shouldn't have.</p>
